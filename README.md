# Robot Import Timber Model

This application is meant to be bundled into a single file executable that forms part of the backend for the [Timber Structural Design Software](https://github.com/SeifFahmy/timber-structural-design).

It accepts a string containing the case IDs the user wants to consider for the design in Tedds, then connects to Robot using its API to import the IDs and the maximum forces of all timber members.
